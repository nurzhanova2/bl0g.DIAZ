        <p class="lead my-3"> Gravitation cannot be held responsible for people
            falling in love. How on earth can you explain in terms of chemistry and physics
            so important a biological phenomenon as first love? Put your hand on a stove for
            a minute and it seems like an hour.
            Sit with that special girl for an hour and it seems like a minute. That's relativity.</p>

    <h2>ACTION IS THE FOUNDATIONAL KEY TO ALL SUCCESS </h2>
    <p>Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do.
        So throw off the bowlines.
        Catch the trade winds in your sails.
